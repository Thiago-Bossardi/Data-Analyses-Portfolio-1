# Data-Analyses-Portfolio-1
I am a driven and dedicated individual with a varied and impressive array of practical experience. I am now keen to utilise this expertise to embark on an exciting and challenging position as data analyst. I feel my skills and experience are closely matched to what is required in this role.
In academic terms, I have a degree in International Trade and I have since, gone onto complete a data analysis course, including a Google Data Analytics Certificate, which covered a number of key areas including Spreadsheets (MS Excel and Google Sheets), SQL and Tableau. I have also dedicated some of my time to studying Python. 
I have also dedicated a lot of my time to build a portfolio that show my abilities in the field of data analyses and here is where is the place I choose to share it.
Please, feel free to reach me out if you have any comments.
